# OpenSwitch

An ambitious project to provide what Nintendo doesn't.

Current experience for Nintendo Switch eshop is somewhat poor: it's laggy on
console, there are tons of games but you have to google them to find out what
they're really about.

OpenSwitch aims to answer the following question:

- "Is this game worth the buck?"

- "Can you suggest me a new game?"

And it'll do it having **automatic recommendation** of new games, **price
history**, **sales alert**, and so on.


## Open

*Open* in *OpenSwitch* means open to collaboration for anyone who wants to help
build this project.

This doesn't mean just "write some code" but also suggesting new improvements,
features, reporting problems and so on.

It also means that all the gathered data will be available to use for free.

Plus, it's 100% open source! If you can also write some code just ping me and
I'll be super happy about it.


## Alternatives

OpenSwitch has been in my head for a long time and other apps have been
made while I was struggling finding some free time. There are some other great
projects out there:

- https://esho.pw, made by myself. Just price comparisons, no fancy features.
- https://dekudeals.com, the most famous. Nice features, you should check this
  out.
- https://savecoins.app
- https://eshop-prices.com

So why am I still doing another one?

I don't want to just build an app. I want to build a **community**, engaging
users in different ways (e.g. ratings or reviews).
